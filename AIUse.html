        <p>
            I have used tools from .net SDK to generate basic API's and then
            customize them, also I have used material ui templates to create the
            ui
        </p>

        <h1>AI</h1>
        <h3>AI was used for interternationalization. Chatgpt was used.</h3>
        <p>
            There were prompts like: "SOME REACT COMPONENT" for this component
            create an en.json and pl.json for i18n. The idea of those were to
            create json translation configs.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            There was prompt asking: For "CreateRecipe" component create
            validation rules based on signIn and signUp components.
